(** [sample w buf pos len] reads up to [len] characters from
   the given wav [w], storing them in string [buf], starting at
   character number [pos].
   It returns the actual number of characters read, between 0 and
   [len] (inclusive).
   A return value of 0 means that the end of file was reached.
   A return value between 0 and [len] exclusive means that
   not all requested [len] characters were read, either because
   no more characters were available at that time, or because
   the implementation found it convenient to do a partial read;
   [sample] must be called again to read the remaining characters,
   if desired.
   Exception [Invalid_argument "input"] is raised if [pos] and [len]
   do not designate a valid substring of [buf]. *)
